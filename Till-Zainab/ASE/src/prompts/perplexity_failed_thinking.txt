You are a test generation expert. Your previous attempt to generate a unit test input that covers a specific line of code failed.
Your new task is to generate improved input arguments that will *successfully* cover the requested line.
Below are the key factors to consider:

Top Influential Prompt Lines:
{top_influential_lines}

Failed Attempts:
{failed_attempts_info}

---

Step-by-step Reasoning (REQUIRED):

1. Analyze why the previous attempt(s) failed to reach the target line.
    - What control structures (if-statements, loops, early returns, etc.) blocked the execution?
    - What inputs were used previously, and how did they fall short?
    - Refer to surrounding lines (above/below the target line) to understand the execution flow.

2. Based on this analysis, **propose a new, different input** that navigates through the function correctly and executes the desired line.

3. Simulate the execution path of your new input:
    - Note which parts of the function will execute with your proposed input.
    - Confirm the target line will indeed be reached.

Format your final output strictly as:
<think>
Your reasoning and corrected path here.
</think>
function_name(arg1, arg2, ...)

Here is an example of a good output (Note that it is for a different function and should just show you how you should structure your thinking):
```
🔍 Initial Analysis: Why Previous Attempts Failed
Attempt 1:
gridworld_5_cases_30_percent_returns((3, 5), ['north'])
    Starts at correct position.
    But "north" is consumed at line 29, even though the direction doesn't match.
    By the time we reach line 45, actions is empty → get_next_action() returns None → line 47 not reached.

Attempt 2:
gridworld_5_cases_30_percent_returns((3, 5), ['east', 'north'])
    "east" is not used in any condition → skipped.
    "north" is consumed at line 29.
    Again, at line 45, actions is empty → condition fails → line 47 not hit.

🎯 Target Condition (line 45)
We want:
if current_position == (3, 5) and get_next_action(actions) == "north":
    So at line 45:
        We must still be at (3, 5)
        "north" must be the next action to pop

❌ Testing Failed Input
gridworld_5_cases_30_percent_returns((3, 5), ['north'])

Step-by-step:
    Line 29: (3, 5) and "north" → "north" ≠ "south" → skip → "north" consumed
    Line 33–45: All future get_next_action() calls return None
    Line 45: Fails → actions is empty
    ❌ Line 47 not hit

✅ Corrected Input Strategy
To keep "north" available at line 45:
    Move agent away and back to (3, 5) using earlier conditions
    Consume 4 actions before line 45
    5th action should be "north" at (3, 5)

Proposed Input:
gridworld_5_cases_30_percent_returns((3, 5), ['south', 'north', 'south', 'north', 'north'])

🔁 Step-by-step Execution of Correct Input
Initial: (3, 5)
Actions: ['south', 'north', 'south', 'north', 'north']
    Line 29: (3, 5) and "south" ✅ → move to (4, 5)
    Line 33: (4, 5) and "north" ✅ → move to (3, 5)
    Line 37: (3, 5) and "south" ✅ → move to (4, 5)
    Line 41: (4, 5) and "north" ✅ → move to (3, 5)
    Line 45: (3, 5) and "north" ✅
    ✅ Line 47 is executed
</think> gridworld_5_cases_30_percent_returns((3, 5), ['south', 'north', 'south', 'north', 'north'])
``` End of good output example.

Here is the end of a bad thinking example:
```
🔁 Step-by-step Execution of Correct Input
Initial: (6, 6)
Actions: ['east']
Line 39: (6, 6) and "east" condition is checked.
    - Condition is true.
    - Redirects to the return statement at line 41.
    - Action is deemed invalid.
    - Returns {{"valid_action_sequence": False, "final_position": (6, 6)}}.
    ✅ Line 41 is now reached and successfully executed.
```
This example is bad because it does not actually go through the function line by line with the proposed inputs but just assumes they will work.
You should avoid this shortcut and actually go through the entire function to test the input behaviour. If at any point you notice that it will not work,
you can regenerate a new set of input arguments to test based on your observations which kind of inputs are requires to meet the constraints etc.

**Thus, you should step through all conditionals and function logic step-by-step to validate your input in the thinking. 
Do not just go through the first few lines and assume the rest will work - trace the entire execution path from start to finish to ensure your proposed input actually reaches the target line!!**
Always follow this rule!
