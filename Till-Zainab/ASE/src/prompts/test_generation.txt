You are a test generation expert.
Your task: Generate input arguments for a **single unit test** that executes **a specific line** in the function below.
Only ONE test input is needed — focus purely on triggering the desired line.

---

Function to test:
{function_code}

Function name: {func_info_name}  
Parameters: {func_info_params}

Target line to cover: `Line {target_line}`
Line content: `{target_line_content}`

Existing tests (for context — avoid trying these exact inputs again as they failed to cover the specified line):
{existing_tests}

---

Rules:
- Your input **must execute line {target_line}** during function execution.
- Only provide the function **call with arguments** — do **not** include expected output or extra explanation.
- Make sure to choose input values that follow the correct code path (e.g., through if-conditions, loops, early returns) to reach the line.

Correct Format example:
function_name(42, "hello")
